My attempt at learning Rust by porting [this project](https://github.com/fmenozzi/2d-graphics-engine) from C++. Goals for now are just to re-create all images from the original project.

I've also experimented with using triangles as primitives, rather than trying to re-write that monster function for filling generic convex polygons. Results are promising so far.

Run `make results` to generate PNG images in the `results/png` directory.
